# Project Details

- ### 3D First-Person Shooter

- ### 10 weeks half-time

- ### Custom 3D game engine

# Contributions

- **PhysX** - I integrated static collisions with PhysX, including cooking and instancing the rigidbodies and having them interact with the player.
- **Networking** - I implemented all the backend for our networked messaging system.
- **Scripting** - I wrote a scripting abstraction layer on top of Lua 5.1 with LuaJIT, used for events such as transitioning levels and opening doors.
- **Player** - I implemented our player, including movement, shooting, animations, jumping, health and damage, sprinting, crouching, and reloading.
- **Performance** - I made various optimizations throughout the project, most notably replacing our SSAO postprocessing with an efficient bilateral blur, increasing both performance and fidelity.
