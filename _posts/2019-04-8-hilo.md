# Project Details

- ### 3D Space Shooter

- ### 10 weeks half-time

- ### Custom 3D game engine

# Contributions

- **Engine** - I wrote and designed a lot of our core engine framework, including resource handling, scene and object management, and loading levels exported from the Unity editor.
- **Threading** - I wrote a predictive threading engine that sits at the core of our engine loop; you can read more about it [here]({{ '2019/04/threading' | relative_url }}).
- **Rendering** - I helped set up a lot of our core rendering architecture and the forward renderer we used at the start of development.
- **Text** - I wrote a font loader around Freetype2 and implemented a text renderer as well as the api for using it in the game.
- **Showroom** - I created and maintained a special scene in our engine designed to help artists and technical artists to view their models convienitently in-engine in differently lit envionments.
- **Player & Camera** - I worked on the player's flying mechanics as well as the camera-pulley that provides the smooth transitions as the player manouvers.
- **Checkpoints** - I set up the checkpoint system and the UI-markers that lead the player towards them.
